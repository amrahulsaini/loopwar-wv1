# 🔒 SECURITY FIX: Email Verification Properly Implemented

## ❌ **Security Issue Fixed**

**Problem**: Verification codes were being exposed in the API response, which is a major security vulnerability.

```json
// BEFORE (INSECURE)
{
  "success": true,
  "verificationCode": "123456", // ❌ EXPOSED!
  "message": "Account created"
}
```

```json
// AFTER (SECURE)
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Please check your email for verification code",
  "requiresVerification": true
}
```

## 🛡️ **Security Improvements**

### Environment Variables Required
Set these in your Vercel dashboard:

```env
SMTP_HOST=smtp-relay.brevo.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-smtp-username
SMTP_PASS=your-smtp-password
SMTP_FROM=verify@loopwar.dev
```

### Verification Flow
1. **User signs up** → Account created with `isVerified: false`
2. **Email sent** → 6-digit code delivered to user's email
3. **User enters code** → Must check email for verification
4. **Verification successful** → Account activated, access granted
5. **Zone access** → Only available after email verification
